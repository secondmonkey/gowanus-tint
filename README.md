============

* The Gowanus canal in Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn is a marvelous if horribly polluted waterway. It changes color pretty dramatically from day-to-day. This project uses PIL (the Python Imaging Library) to extract average colors from photos and then renders them onto a polygon on a Mapbox map, to track the mood of the canal.
